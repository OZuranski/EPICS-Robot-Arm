# Project Manus
 
Project Manus is a student lead team part of Purdue University's EPICS ECE Outreach program. Our main goal with Project Manus is to showcase engineering design principles to prospective students through an interactive, easy to build robotic arm. The arm was modeled in Fusion 360 with mostly 3D printed parts and common electronics to remain accessible for schools and hobbyists. It features 5 degrees of freedom, RC controls, and stepper motors, all controled by an Arduino for expandibility. The endeffector can be replaced with various attatchments such as a claw or a pen. ![video1](Media/20241126_173315.mp4)
